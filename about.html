      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>As developers and online users ourselves, we often found ourselves needing tiny tools for simple tasks — but most solutions online were hidden behind ads, popups, trackers, or paywalls. We built Micro Tools Hub as an open, free alternative that puts the user experience first.</p>
